                                <p>Dear User,</p>
                                <p>To initiate the deletion of your account on our platform, please follow the steps
                                    outlined below. Please note that account deletion cannot be performed directly
                                    through the mobile app. Instead, you will need to send a deletion request via email
                                    to <a href="tastefooddelivery@gmail.com"><strong>tastefooddelivery@gmail.com</strong></a>.</p>
                                <h3><strong>Step 1: Prepare Your Deletion Request</strong></h3>
                                <p>Compose an email with the subject line "Account Deletion Request" and include the
                                    following information in the body of the email:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Your username</li>
                                    <li>Your registered mobile number</li>
                                    <li>Reason for account deletion: [Please provide a brief explanation of why you are
                                        requesting the deletion of your account.]</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3><strong>Step 2: Send Your Deletion Request</strong></h3>
                                <p>Once you have prepared the email containing your account deletion request and
                                    provided the required information, send it to <a
                                        href="tastefooddelivery@gmail.com"><strong>tastefooddelivery@gmail.com</strong></a></p>
                                <h3><strong>Step 3: Verification</strong></h3>
                                <p>For security purposes, our team will verify your identity based on the information
                                    provided in your deletion request. This is to ensure that only authorized users can
                                    request the deletion of their accounts.</p>
                                <h3><strong>Step 4: Confirmation</strong></h3>
                                <p>Upon successful verification, you will receive a confirmation email stating that your
                                    account deletion request has been received and is being processed. We aim to revert
                                    to you within 14 days of receiving your request.</p>
                                <h3><strong>Step 5: Deletion Process</strong></h3>
                                <p>Our team will proceed with the deletion of your account and associated data from our
                                    platform. Please note that this process may take some time to complete. However, we
                                    endeavor to clear your data within 90 days of receiving your deletion request.</p>
                                <h3><strong>Step 6: Consequences</strong></h3>
                                <p>Please be aware that once your account is deleted, you will no longer have access to
                                    any features or services associated with it. Additionally, any data or content
                                    associated with your account will be permanently removed from our platform.</p>
